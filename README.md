## Welcome to 42cursus-cpp-module-05!
This is the sixth project featuring C++ at the [42 school].

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn the principles of the exception handling in C++.

The project is all about the example of bureaucrates with certain grades. Whenever a grade does not complain to the
requirements of the form, an exception is thrown. The example is extended throughout the four exercises.
